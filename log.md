# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a Edit Distance question & understood concepts of Dynamic Programming.

**Thoughts:** I used Tabulation to solve the problem with O(mxn) space & time complexity. Next I'm looking forward to solving the same problem using Memoisation which will help to reduce the space complexity to O(m).

### Day 01: July 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1) Solved a LCS question & understood concepts of Recursion.
2) Solved LCS question with Memoization.
3) Solved LCS with Tabulation
4)Print the LCS in two strings

**Thoughts:** I used Recursion to solve the problem with O(2^n) time complexity. This was  naive recursive approach. and I will try the same with DP next time.
Edit: I solved the DP based technique to solve the problem in O(mxn) time.

### Day 02: July 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1) Solved minimum cost triplets question.
2) Solved Fractional Knapsack Problem
3) Started solving Recursive COin Combination problem

**Thoughts:** I used simple if else logic to solve the problem in O(N^2) time after optimising it from O(N^3). Other than this, I solved Fractional Knapsack, which I had not quite remembered, so it was helpful solving it. Overall time complexity O(nlogn). Besides all these, I learnt the usage of "Pair" in C++ STL.
