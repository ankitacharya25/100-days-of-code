# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a Edit Distance question & unedrstood concepts of Dynamic Programming.

**Thoughts:** I used Tabulation to solve the problem with O(mxn) space & time complexity. Next I'm looking forward to solving the same problem using Memoisation which will help to reduce the space complexity to O(m).

**Link to work:** []()
