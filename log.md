# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a Edit Distance question & understood concepts of Dynamic Programming.

**Thoughts:** I used Tabulation to solve the problem with O(mxn) space & time complexity. Next I'm looking forward to solving the same problem using Memoisation which will help to reduce the space complexity to O(m).

### Day 01: July 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1) Solved a LCS question & understood concepts of Recursion.
2) Solved LCS question with Memoization.
3) Solved LCS with Tabulation
4)Print the LCS in two strings

**Thoughts:** I used Recursion to solve the problem with O(2^n) time complexity. This was  naive recursive approach. and I will try the same with DP next time.
Edit: I solved the DP based technique to solve the problem in O(mxn) time.

### Day 02: July 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1) Solved minimum cost triplets question.
2) Solved Fractional Knapsack Problem
3) Started solving Recursive COin Combination problem

**Thoughts:** I used simple if else logic to solve the problem in O(N^2) time after optimising it from O(N^3). Other than this, I solved Fractional Knapsack, which I had not quite remembered, so it was helpful solving it. Overall time complexity O(nlogn). Besides all these, I learnt the usage of "Pair" in C++ STL.

### Day 03: July 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1) Solved Maximal Square Problem using DP
Q. In a 2-D Binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the area of the largest square containing only 1's. (Leetcode)
2) Binary Search to find the peak element in array in O(logN) time

**Today's Progress**: 1) Contiguous subarray with maximum sum O(n)
2) Minimum steps in infinte Grid(InterviewBit).
3) Minimum Lights to Activate (Overlapping lamp question)
