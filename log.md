# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a Edit Distance question & understood concepts of Dynamic Programming.

**Thoughts:** I used Tabulation to solve the problem with O(mxn) space & time complexity. Next I'm looking forward to solving the same problem using Memoisation which will help to reduce the space complexity to O(m).

### Day 01: July 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 1) Solved a LCS question & understood concepts of Recursion.
2) Solved LCS question with Memoization.
3) Solved LCS with Tabulation

**Thoughts:** I used Recursion to solve the problem with O(2^n) time complexity. This was  naive recursive approach. and I will try the same with DP next time.
Edit: I solved the DP based technique to solve the problem in O(mxn) time.
